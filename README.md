## Backstory

One of the best parts of my job is that I get to travel and work all over the
world. I am frequently exposed to different environments and cultures; with each
new location shifting & developing my perspective & understanding of the world
I live in.

More recently, I was fortunate enough to be presented with the opportunity to
spend a couple of months in Tokyo working as a Technical Consultant for
[Ultra Super New][usn]. This was my first time in Asia so I was both excited and
a little anxious about being a total alien in this far away land.

On arrival I was overwhelmed by the heat and barrage of information that I
simply could not understand. In between the resteraunts, bars, boutiques and
monolithic skyscrapers; dolls, robots and manga paint the walls, billboards,
vehicles and packaging. This childlike mentality is an integral part of society
and it charms the pants off me. The saturated innocence instills a great sense
of peace and respect for one another and as a result, Japan is an incredibly
safe place to live.

**The world could learn a lot from Japan.**

Beyond the beautiful artwork lies deep, fantastical and often complex stories
which question life, relationships and ideas. The leverage of this medium is
quite simply wonderful.

One of the lovliest stories I have heard so far is that of Danbo. Danbo (short
for Danboru, the Japanese word for corrugated cardboard) is a cardboard robot
built by a young girl looking for a companion, and brought to life by her belief
in his existance alone. Though the story is a reasonably common one, recently
depicted in the film [Ted][ted], I personally love the idea that Danbo was the
sole creation of one girl – naive to the rigid constraints of the world.

I learnt of Danbo when one of my collegues errupted with glee when she finally
recieved a parcel containing an [80mm figurine][amazon] of Danbo. Unable to
contain herself, she proceeded to tell the story, and so, as a visual ode to my
time in Tokyo, I decided to create Danbo for the web.

Created using CSS3D, Danbo is intended to exist in your smart device – reacting
to the motion of the gyroscope causing him to tumble around inside a box. The
ragdoll physics are created using [ammo.js][ammo] and the artwork is that of my
own.

For the best experience, view the project on a modern smart device like an
iPhone or iPad. The project has also been built to function as a web
application, so go ahead and add it to your homescreen!
