## Backstory

One of the best aspects of my vocation is that I get to travel and work all over
the world. I am frequently exposed to different environments and cultures; with
each new location shifting & developing my perspective & understanding of the
world I live in.

More recently, I was fortunate enough to be presented with the opportunity to
spend a couple of months in Tokyo working as a Technical Consultant for
[Ultra Super New][usn]. This was my first time in Asia so I was both excited and
a little anxious about being a total alien in such a far-away-land.

On arrival I was overwhelmed by the barrage of information that I simply could
not understand. In between the resteraunts, bars, boutiques and monolithic
skyscrapers – dolls, robots and manga paint the walls, billboards, vehicles and
packaging. This childlike mentality is an integral part of Tokyo's facade and
it charms the pants off me. The saturated innocence instills a great sense of
peace and respect for one another and as a result, Japan is an incredibly safe
place to live.

**The world could learn a lot from Japan.**

Beyond the beautiful artwork lies deep, fantastical and often complex stories
which question life, relationships and a full spectrum of ideas. The leverage of
this medium is quite simply wonderful.

One of the lovliest stories I have heard so far is that of Danbo. Danbo (short
for Danboru, the Japanese word for corrugated cardboard) is a cardboard robot
built by a young girl longing for a companion – brought to life by her belief
in his existance alone. Though the premise of the story is a reasonably common
one—recently depicted in the film [Ted][ted]—I personally love the idea that
Danbo was the sole creation of one girl – naive to the seemingly rigid
constraints of the universe.

I learnt of Danbo when one of my collegues errupted with glee when she finally
recieved a parcel containing an [80mm figurine][amazon] of Danbo. Unable to
contain herself, she proceeded to tell the story, and so, as a visual ode to my
time in Tokyo, I decided to create Danbo for the web.

Created using CSS3D, Danbo is intended to exist in your smart device – reacting
to the motion of the gyroscope causing him to tumble around inside a box. The
ragdoll physics are created using [ammo.js][ammo] and the artwork is that of my
own.

For the best experience, view the project on a modern smart device equipped with
a gyroscope like an iPhone or iPad. The project has also been built to function
as a web application, so go ahead and add it to your homescreen!
